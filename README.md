# Factoral-Methods-using-two-different-method
Here, I am finding the factorial of a number by using two different method. The first method is by using for loop and the second method is recursion method. Here recursion method is something tricky. It automatically use the computational power of computer but, its not the efficient method of finding factorial of number.
